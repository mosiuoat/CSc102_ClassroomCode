# CSc102_ClassroomCode
This is where I will be uploading the source code of the C# projects that we code in class. The code is divided into solutions named after the weeks. So there will be four solutions come the end of the module. Each solution has a couple of projects named after the day in the week when that code was written. Daily projects should be available shortly after the lecture.
